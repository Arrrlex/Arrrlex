## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alex McKenzie. I care a lot about mitigating risks from Artificial Intelligence. I also care about music, type systems, and Effective Altruism.

I blog occasionally at [alexmck.com](https://alexmck.com).

## Curated Projects

I'm still working on building a portfolio of publicly-accessible projects, but here's an amouse-bouche:

- [My capstone project from ARENA](https://github.com/Arrrlex/arena4-capstone), in which I use function vectors to get LLMs to lie
- [A blog post](https://alexmck.com/posts/sampling-from-any-distribution-2/) with [accompanying code](https://github.com/Arrrlex/sampling-from-any-distribution) about programmatically sampling from arbitrary probability distributions
- [A small project from my masters](https://github.com/Arrrlex/bdqm-hyperparam-tuning): a CLI for doing hyperparameter optimization on a DL framework for quantum chemistry simulations.
